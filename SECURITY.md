# Security Policy

## Introduction

We are committed to safeguarding your data's security and integrity. This policy outlines our approach to handling security vulnerabilities and disclosure.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability in DBChat, please report it privately to:
- [@vdsabev](https://x.com/vdsabev)
- [@boyankostov](https://x.com/boyankostov)

Include:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Relevant code or configuration files

## Supported Versions

Only the latest DBChat release is supported. Always use the latest version for current security patches.

## Disclosure Guidelines

We maintain a private disclosure policy. Report vulnerabilities to the listed maintainers. We will address reports promptly and delay public disclosure until a patch is available to prevent exploitation.

## Security Vulnerability Response Process

We respond swiftly to vulnerability reports by:
- Investigating and verifying the issue
- Developing and releasing a patch
- Notifying users about the vulnerability and fix

## Template Attribution
